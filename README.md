# FouTS
A toolset written in C++ for characterising white matter tracts from diffusion MRI using Fourier Tract Sampling (FouTS),
which is released under the GNU Public Licence version 3.0 (see LICENCE for details).

FouTS is an method for characterising white matter tracts from diffusion MRI using Bayesian inference and Markov-chain
Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which is described in the accompanying paper:

Close TG, Tournier J-D, Johnston LA, Calamante F, Mareels I, Connelly A, (2015) _Fourier Tract Sampling (FouTS): 
A framework for improved inference of white matter tracts from diffusion MRI by explicitly modelling tract volume_,
_NeuroImage_, accepted. 

If you use any part of this software package please include a citation to the above paper.

NB: FouTS is currently somewhere between alpha and beta, so is probably not ready for general consumption at this stage
