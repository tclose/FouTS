    * Use the C++ TR1 unordered_map instead of hash_map by default
    * This avoids compilation warnings on newer compilers.
    * The old SGI hash_map can be used by removing the USE_TR1 macro on the command-line
    * (i.e. remove the '-DUSE_TR1' entry in the cpp_flags line of the relevant sysconf file).
