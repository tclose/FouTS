   * progress bar.

   * It has two modes of operation:
   * - percentage completion: if the maximum value is non-zero, then the
   * percentage completed will be displayed. Each call to
   * ProgressBar::operator++() will increment the value by one, and the
   * percentage displayed is computed from the current value with respect to
   * the maximum specified.
   * - busy indicator: if the maximum value is set to zero, then a 'busy'
   * indicator will be shown instead. For the command-line version, this
   * consists of a dot moving from side to side.
   *
   * Other implementations can be created by overriding the display_func() and
   * done_func() static functions. These functions will then be used throughout
   * the application.  */
