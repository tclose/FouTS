     * so that they can be executed in parallel using the Thread::Exec class.
     * Note that the original functor will be used, and as many copies will be

     * num_threads is given by Thread::available_cores().

     * the copy consructor behave as expected.
     *
     * For example:
     * \code
     * void my_function () {
     *   // Create master copy of functor:
     *   MyThread my_thread (param);
     *

     *   // Each copy is created using the copy constructor:
     *   Thread::Array<MyThread> list (my_thread);
     *
     *   // Launch all copies in parallel:
     *   Thread::Exec threads (list, "my threads");
     * } // all copies in the array are deleted when the array goes out of scope.
