    //! Synchronise threads by waiting on a condition
    /*! This class allows threads to wait until a specific condition is
     * fulfilled, at which point the thread responsible for reaching that
     * condition will signal that the other waiting threads can be woken up.
     * These are used in conjunction with a Thread::Mutex object to protect the
     * relevant data. For example, the waiting thread may be executing:
     * \code
     * Thread::Mutex mutex;
     * Thread::Cond cond (mutex);
     * ...
     * void process_data () {
     *   while (true) {
     *     { // Mutex must be locked prior to waiting on condition
     *       Thread::Mutex::Lock lock (mutex);
     *       while (no_data()) cond.wait();
     *       get_data();
     *     } // Mutex is released as soon as possible
     *     ...
     *     // process data
     *     ...
     *   }
     * }
     * \endcode
     * While the thread producing the data may be executing:
     * \code
     * void produce_data () {
     *   while (true) {
     *     ...
     *     // generate next batch of data
     *     ...
     *     { // Mutex must be locked prior to sending signal
     *       Thread::Mutex::Lock lock (mutex);
     *       submit_data();
     *       cond.signal();
     *     } // Mutex must be released for other threads to run
     *   }
     * }
     * \endcode
