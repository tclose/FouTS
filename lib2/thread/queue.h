    //! A first-in first-out thread-safe item queue
    /*! This class implements a thread-safe means of pushing data items into a
     * queue, so that they can each be processed in one or more separate
     * threads. It has somewhat unusual usage, which consists of the following
     * steps:
     * - Create an instance of a Thread::Queue
     * - Create one or more instances of the corresponding
     * Thread::Queue::Writer class, each constructed with a reference to the
     * queue. Each of these instances will automatically notify the queue that
     * its corresponding thread will be writing to the queue.
     * - Create one or more instances of the corresponding
     * Thread::Queue::Reader class, each constructed with a reference to the
     * queue. Each of these instances will automatically notify the queue that
     * its corresponding thread will be reading from the queue.
     * - Launch all threads, one per instance of Thread::Queue::Writer or
     *   Thread::Queue::Reader. Note that one of these threads can be the
     *   current thread - simply invoke the respective functor's execute()
     *   method directly once all other threads have been launched.
     * - Within the execute() method of each thread with a
     * Thread::Queue::Writer:
     *   - create an instance of Thread::Queue::Writer::Item, constructed from
     *   the corresponding Thread::Queue::Writer;
     *   - perform processing in a loop:
     *     - prepare the item using pointer semantics (i.e. *item or
     *     item->method());
     *     - use the write() method of this class to write to the queue;
     *     - break out of loop if write() returns \c false.
     *   - when the execute() method returns, the destructor of the
     *   Thread::Queue::Writer::Item class will notify the queue that its
     *   thread has finished writing to the queue.
     * - Within the execute() method of each thread with a
     * Thread::Queue::Reader:
     *   - create an instance of Thread::Queue::Reader::Item, constructed from
     *   the corresponding Thread::Queue::Reader;
     *   - perform processing in a loop:
     *     - use the read() method of this class to read the next item from the
     *     queue;
     *     - break out of the loop if read() returns \c false;
     *     - process the item using pointer semantics (i.e. *item or
     *     item->method()).
     *   - when the execute() method returns, the destructor of the
     *   Thread::Queue::Reader::Item class will notify the queue that its
     *   thread has finished reading from the queue.
     * - If all reader threads have returned, the queue will notify all writer
     * threads that processing should stop, by returning \c false from the next
     * write attempt.
     * - If all writer threads have returned and no items remain in the queue,
     * the queue will notify all reader threads that processing should stop, by
     * returning \c false from the next read attempt.
     *
     * The additional member classes are designed to be used in conjunction
     * with the MRtrix multi-threading interface. In this system, each thread
     * corresponds to an instance of a functor class, and its execute() method
     * is the function that will be run within the thread (see Thread::Exec for
     * details). For this reason:
     * - The Thread::Queue instance is designed to be created before any of the
     *   threads.
     * - The Thread::Queue::Writer and Thread::Queue::Reader classes are
     *   designed to be used as members of each functor, so that each functor
     *   must construct these classes from a reference to the queue within
     *   their own constructor. This ensures each thread registers their
     *   intention to read or write with the queue \e before their thread is
     *   launched.
     * - The Thread::Queue::Writer::Item and Thread::Queue::Reader::Item
     *   classes are designed to be instantiated within each functor's
     *   execute() method. They must be constructed from a reference to a
     *   Thread::Queue::Writer or Thread::Queue::Reader respectively, ensuring
     *   no reads or write can take place without having registered with the
     *   queue. Their destructors will also unregister from the queue, ensuring
     *   that each thread unregisters as soon as the execute() method returns,
     *   and hence \e before the thread exits.
     *
     * The Queue class performs all memory management for the items in the
     * queue. For this reason, the items are accessed via the Writer::Item &
     * Reader::Item classes, and constructed using the Allocator class passed
     * as a template parameter for the queue. This allows items to be recycled
     * once they have been processed, reducing overheads associated with memory
     * allocation/deallocation. If you need the items to be constructed using a
     * non-default constructor, then you will need to create your own
     * allocator. See Thread::DefaultAllocator for details.
     *
     * \note It is important that all instances of Thread::Queue::Writer and
     * Thread::Queue::Reader are created \e before any of the threads are
     * launched, to avoid any race conditions at startup.
     *
     * The use of Thread::Queue is best illustrated with an example:
     * \code
     * // the type of objects that will be sent through the queue:
     * class Item {
     *   public:
     *     ...
     *     // data members
     *     ...
     * };
     *
     *
     * // The use a typedef is recommended to help with readability (and typing!):
     * typedef Thread::Queue<Item> MyQueue;
     *
     *
     * // this class will write to the queue:
     * class Sender {
     *   public:
     *     // construct the 'writer' member in the constructor:
     *     Sender (MyQueue& queue) : writer (queue) { }
     *
     *     void execute () {
     *       // use a local instance of Thread::Queue<Item>::Writer::Item to write to the queue:
     *       MyQueue::Writer::Item item (writer);
     *       while (need_more_items()) {
     *         ...
     *         // prepare item
     *         *item = something();
     *         item->set (something_else);
     *         ...
     *         if (!item.write()) break; // break if write() returns false
     *       }
     *     }
     *
     *   private:
     *     MyQueue::Writer writer;
     * };
     *
     *
     * // this class will read from the queue:
     * class Receiver {
     *   public:
     *     // construct the 'reader' member in the constructor:
     *     Receiver (MyQueue& queue) : reader (queue) { }
     *
     *     void execute () {
     *       // use a local instance of Thread::Queue<Item>::Reader::Item to read from the queue:
     *       MyQueue::Reader::Item item (reader);
     *       while ((item.read())) { // break when read() returns false
     *         ...
     *         // process item
     *         do_something (*item);
     *         if (item->status()) report_error();
     *         ...
     *         if (enough_items()) return;
     *       }
     *     }
     *
     *   private:
     *     MyQueue::Reader reader;
     * };
     *
     *
     * // this is where the queue and threads are created:
     * void my_function () {
     *   // create an instance of the queue:
     *   MyQueue queue;
     *
     *   // create all functors from a reference to the queue:
     *   Sender sender (queue);
     *   Receiver receiver (queue);
     *
     *   // once all functors are created, launch their corresponding threads:
     *   Thread::Exec sender_thread (sender);
     *   Thread::Exec receiver_thread (receiver);
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * \par Rationale for the Writer, Reader, and Item member classes
     *
     * The motivation for the use of additional member classes to perform the
     * actual process of writing and reading to and from the queue is related
     * to the need to keep track of the number of processes currently using the
     * queue. This is essential to ensure that threads are notified when the
     * queue is closed. This happens either when all readers have finished
     * reading; or when all writers have finished writing and no items are left
     * in the queue. This is complicated by the need to ensure that the various
     * operations are called in the right order to avoid deadlocks.
     *
     * There are essentially 4 operations that need to take place:
     * - registering an intention to read/write from/to the queue
     * - launching the corresponding thread
     * - unregistering from the queue
     * - terminating the thread
     *
     * For proper multi-threaded operations, these operations must take place
     * in the order above. Moreover, each operation must be completed for
     * all users of the queue before any of them can perform the next
     * operation. The use of additional member classes ensures that threads
     * have to register their intention to read or write from the queue, and
     * that they unregister from the queue once their processing is done.
     *
     * While this could have been achieved simply with the appropriate member
     * functions (i.e. register(), unregister(), %read() & %write() methods in
     * the main Queue class), this places a huge burden on the developer to get
     * it right. Using these member functions reduces the chance of coding
     * errors, and in fact reduces the total amount of code that needs to be
     * written to use the Queue in a safe manner.
     *
     * The Item classes additionally simplify the memory management of the
     * items in the queue, by preventing direct access to the underlying
     * pointers, and ensuring the Queue itself is responsible for all
     * allocation and deallocation of items as needed.
