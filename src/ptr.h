  //! A simple smart pointer implementation
  /*! A simple pointer class that will delete the object it points to when it
   * is destroyed. This is useful to ensure that allocated objects are
   * destroyed without having to explicitly delete them before every possible
   * exit point. It behaves in almost all other respects like a standard
   * pointer. For example:
   * \code
   * void my_function () {
   *   Ptr<Object> object (new Object);
   *
   *   object->member = something;       // member-by-pointer operator
   *   call_by_reference (*object);      // dereference operator
   *   call_by_pointer (object);         // get actual address of object by implicit casting
   *   object = new Object (parameters); // delete previous object and point to new one
   *
   *   if (something) return; // object goes out of scope: pointer is freed in destructor
   *
   *   ...
   *   // do something useful
   *   ...
   *   if (error) throw Exception ("oops"); // pointer is freed in destructor
   *   ...
   * } // object goes out of scope: pointer is freed in destructor
   * \endcode
   *
   * If the objects to be managed are actually arrays, then the \a is_array
   * template parameter should be set to \c true. For example:
   * \code
   * Ptr<Object,true> array (new Object[10]);
   *
   * array[2] = something;
   * call_by_reference (array[2]);
   * call_by_pointer (array + 2);
   * array = new Object [25];    // delete previous array and point to new one
   * \endcode
   *
   * \note Both the copy constructor and the assignment operator will create
   * deep copies of the object as referenced by the original Ptr (assuming
   * non-NULL). One exception to this is when handling arrays: in this case,
   * the pointer stored in the assigned Ptr will be NULL, and no deep copy will
   * occur. This is due to the fact that the size of the array is unknown, and
   * a deep copy of the full array is therefore impossible.
   *

   * \sa VecPtr A %vector of pointers %to objects
